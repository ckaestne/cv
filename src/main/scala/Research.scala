        <p>
          We investigate approaches to scale various quality assurance strategies to entire configuration
          spaces. Although configurability in software and software product lines is important to customize
          it for different stakeholders and usage scenarios, it causes key challenges for quality assurance.
          Configuration options can change the behavior of a system and can interact with other configuration
          options, leading to an exponential configuration space, often complicated further by constraints.
          For example, the Linux kernel has 13,000 compile-time options alone that could be combined into up
          to 2^13000 configurations; a huge configuration space that can obviously not be assured by looking
          at one configuration at a time. We investigate a wide range of approaches (including parsing,
          type checking, data-flow analysis, testing, energy analysis, and sampling) for a large number of
          languages and environments (conditional compilation in C, load-time options in Java, plugin
          mechanisms in PHP). A typical goal is to make assurance judgements for the entire configuration
          space that is comparable to but much faster than looking at each configuration separately,
          typically by exploiting the similarities among configurations.
        </p><p>
          I think variability-related complexity is a fascinating topic. On the surface it seems impossible
          to deal with the complexity of these huge configuration spaces and it surprising how developers
          cope at all, but a closer look reveals a lot of structure to how variability is used and how it
          is different from other sources of complexity. Configuration spaces are large but finite, which
          opens many interesting possibilities for automated reasoning. Developers intentionally share many
          implementations across configurations and most configuration options intentionally do not interact.
          It is this balance between sharing and variability in finite spaces that allows many innovative
          quality assurance strategies that might not be applicable for other sources of complexity; of
          course other analyses outside of configurable software systems with similar characteristics can
          benefit from the same insights.

        <p>
          Variational analysis is the idea of analyzing the entire configuration space at once instead of
          analyzing individual configurations either brute force or by sampling. Variational analysis typically
          represents the entire program and all its variations together and considers those variations in every
          analysis step. For example, if a variable in a program can have three alternative types depending on
          two configuration options, a type checker would track all alternative types and their corresponding
          conditions and make sure that they are used appropriately in every context.
        </p><p>
          Variational analysis is typically sound and complete with regard to a brute-force strategy -- that is
          it finds exactly the same issues a baseline brute-force analysis would find and introduces no false
          positives -- but much faster because it exploits the similarities in the program. While variations in different parts of the program can interact and lead to
          an exponential explosion, we have shown empirically for many problems that those interactions,
          although they exist, are often relatively rare and local, enabling to scale variational analyses to
          huge configuration spaces as in the Linux kernel with 13000 compile-time options.
        </p><p>
          We have investigated variational analyses and built tools for parsing {cite(oopsla11_typechef)}, type checking {cite(ase08, tosem12, oopsla12)},
          linker checks (compositionality) {cite(oopsla12)}, control-flow and data-flow analysis {cite(fse13)}, and testing {cite(icse14_varex, fosd12_varex)}.
          Furthermore, we have investigated general principles, patterns, and data structures for variational
          analyses {cite(fse13, onward14)} and performed a survey of the field {cite(csur14)}.

    def unpreprocessedC = ResearchTopic(
        "Analysis of Unpreprocessed C Code",
        <p>
            With our TypeChef infrastructure, we have built the first sound and complete parser and analysis
            infrastructure for unpreprocessed C code. Most analyses for C code work on preprocessed code, after
            expanding macros, including files, and deciding conditional compilation conditions, but by preprocessing
            code though, they loose information about all other configurations. For
            the same reason, building tools such as refactoring engines that work on unpreprocessed code that a
            developer edits is very challenging. Before TypeChef, parsing unpreprocessed C code was only possible
            with unsound heuristics or by restricting heavily how developers could use the C preprocessor. The
            TypeChef lexer and parser explore all possible branches of conditional compilation decisions, all
            possible macro expansions, and file inclusions and build an abstract syntax tree representing all
            preprocessor variability of the unpreprocessed C code through choice nodes. TypeChef is sound and
            complete with regard to parsing all preprocessed configurations in a brute-force fashion, but much
            faster: it finds exactly the same bugs and does not reject code that could be parsed after preprocessing.
        </p><p>
            On top of the TypeChef parser, we have built a variational type system and
            variational linker checks {cite(oopsla12)}, a variational data-flow analysis framework {cite(fse13)},
            facilities for variational pointer analysis and variational call graphs.
            Others have used lightweight variations {cite(flavioRef)} or have used TypeChef as the basis
            for imports {cite(mbeddr)} and refactoring engines {cite(joergRefactoringICSE)} that could handle the C
            preprocessor.
        </p><p>
            TypeChef has been used to analyze the entire configuration space of the Linux
            kernelâs x86 architecture (>6000 compile-time options), of Busybox (>800
            compile-time options), OpenSSL, and other highly configurable systems written
            in C.

    def vtypechecking = ResearchTopic(
        "Variational Type Checking and Data-Flow Analysis",
        <p>
            We have built variational type systems, linker checks, and data-flow analyses
            for compile-time variability in Java and C, again instances of the general
            idea of variational analysis. When faced with compile-time variability,
            compiler errors in certain configurations are a common problem, for example,
            when a function is called in a configuration in which it is not defined. Such
            problems may surface only in configurations that require specific combinations
            of multiple options, for example enabling some and disabling others. When end-
            users perform the configuration as in Linux and most plugin systems, one would
            like to ensure the absence of configuration-related compilation errors for the
            entire configuration space.
        </p><p>
            We built our first variational type system for compile-time variability in
            Java code and found bugs in various JavaME applications that used compile-time
            variability {cite(ase08, tosem12)}. Subsequently, we have implemented a variational type system
            and variational linker checks for unpreprocessed C code on top of TypeChef and
            found found various variability-related errors in real world software systems,
            sometimes involving more than 10 configuration options. A key mechanism to
            scale the analysis of large code bases was to perform compositional analysis
            analyzing one C file at a time and subsequently performing variational linker
            checks, for which we have designed and formalized a variational module system
            {cite(oopsla12)}.
        </p><p>
            Furthermore, we have built a variational static analysis framework on top of
            TypeChef that can perform typical data-flow analyses as constant propagation
            and taint tracking over all compile-time configurations {cite(fse13)}. In addition to the
            possibility of finding bugs, these analyses provide a foundation for sound
            variational refactorings of unpreprocessed C code {cite(joergRefactoringICSE)}.

    def vexecution = ResearchTopic(
        "Variational Execution (Testing)",
        <p>
            With variational execution, we try to bring variational analysis to testing
            and dynamic analyses. Again, we track differences and share similarities
            across configurations, but instead of tracking alternative types, we track
            alternative values of variables during execution. That is, we attempt to
            execute a program across all configurations at once: we track all distinct
            values a variable could have in any configuration and explore all branches on
            configuration-related control-flow decisions. In contrast to symbolic
            execution, we use only concrete values, but a variable may have multiple
            concrete values in different configurations. When hitting assertions or
            output, we can simply check all possible values for the entire configuration
            space. Again, we track differences only where they matter and share
            similarities across configurations, which allows us to scale over brute-force
            approaches.
            We have experimented with different implementations, primarily by lifting
            interpreters. We created experimental variational interpreters for PHP {cite(icse14_varex)} and Java {cite(jensThesis)}.
        </p><p>
            Our primary goal is testing highly configurable systems, but we expect that we
            will use the infrastructure for many applications of dynamic analyses to large
            but finite configuration spaces beyond the traditional product line field,
            such as dynamic information-flow analysis and policy enforcement {cite(austinPoplRef, austinWSRef)}.

        <p>
            While I am personally biased toward sound variational analyses that cover entire configuration spaces,
            we have investigated sampling strategies toward quality assurance. Sampling is by its very nature unsound
            with regard to the configuration space because it does not analyze all configurations, but it is typically
            much easier to perform. Among others, we have compared different sampling strategies and have compared
            variational analyses to sampling, where variational analysis can provide a ground truth about issues in
            a system. This allowed us, for example, to study whether the assumptions behind many sampling strategies,
            such as that most issues involve only few configuration options, hold in practice. In addition, we found
            that many sampling strategies are only easy to apply when making strong simplifying assumptions, such as
            that the system does not contain constraints or that each file can be analyzed separately {cite(fse13, icse16)}.

        <p>
            Feature interactions are still a mystery to me. They are emergent properties
            in a system and surface as interoperability problems. They emerge from a
            failure of compositionality, when the behavior of combining two parts is
            unexpected from their individual behaviors. In the common example of flood
            control and fire control in a building, both work fine in isolation but can be
            dangerous if combined incorrectly, as flood control can turn off water from
            the sprinklers in case of a fire. Interactions are often actually intended and
            desired, so pure isolation is rarely an optimal strategy; for example plugins
            of a blogging software should often interact to reach a common goal. Although
            feature interactions have been studied in depth from a requirements
            perspective in the 90s and some success has been achieved in understanding
            interactions and designing for them in specific domains as telecommunications,
            to me it is still largely unclear how we can detect them in practice or design
            new systems to allow intentional interactions but prevent undesired ones. For
            example, how can we ensure orthogonality or isolation of options except for
            those cases where interactions are explicitly intended? How can we help
            developers understand such issues despite huge exponential configuration
            spaces?
        </p><p>
            I am interested in understanding how interactions manifest in implementations,
            for example, at the level of data flow. To that end, we use variational
            analyses (data flow, variational execution) to understand systems. Only when
            we understand current practice can we identify common problems and successful
            patterns for managing interactions. We focus on interactions among options
            (compile-time, run-time, plugins), but take a very wide view on interactions
            that includes diverging behavior, alternative values of a variable depending
            on multiple options, structural interactions as nested #ifdefs, as well as
            performance interactions.
            I am mostly interested in interactions at the code level, but with broad
            ranges of domains, such as infrastructure software, plugin systems, software
            ecosystems, home automation, or medical devices.

            We explore different strategies to specify expected behavior in highly
            configurable systems. If options may interact, what correct behavior do we
            expect? How can we specify behavior in an exponential configuration space,
            when we obviously cannot think about every combination of options separately?
            How do we encode such specifications in test cases or for static analysis or
            verification tools? Global specifications that should uniformly hold across
            all configurations, such as all configurations should be well-typed or should
            not crash are easy to specify. I believe that the only meaningful scalable
            strategy to specify expected behavior and detect inconsistencies of
            interactions is to specify for each feature separately the expected behavior,
            independent of any other options. Such feature-specific specification will
            allow us to detect when that feature is negatively influenced by other
            options. This view shapes my view on interactions and is a main reason for
            pursuing variational execution as an efficient way of checking such
            specifications encoded as test cases in large configuration spaces. I believe
            that writing test cases that assert a featureâs behavior independent from
            other features, combined with variational execution, will allow us to get a
            handle on interoperability and detecting feature interactions.

        <p>
            We explore different approaches to understand how configuration options affect
            performance, power consumption, and other quality attributes of software
            systems. With their configuration options, many configurable software systems
            have a built-in potential to tweak performance and other quality attributes,
            for example to trade off faster encoding with lower video quality in a video
            encoder or longer compile time with faster execution for a compiler in a high-
            performance-computing scenario. However, understanding which configuration
            options affect performance or other quality attributes is difficult. Not all
            configuration options influence performance significantly and sometimes the
            interactions of multiple options have strong positive or negative
            influences---again the scale of the configuration space makes an analysis difficult.
        </p><p>
            We have primarily focused on building performance-influence models and energy-
            influence models in a form of sensitivity analysis in which we measure quality
            attributes in various configurations and subsequently learn a model that
            describes which options and which interactions influence the quality
            attribute. These models are suitable for debugging, understanding, predicting,
            and optimizing quality attributes as performance for highly-configurable
            software systems. For example, by showing the influence of configuration
            options on energy consumption, we expect that users make more energy-conscious
            configuration decisions weighing the benefits of a feature against its
            cost---in a tool we call <em>green configurator</em>.
        </p><p>
            We have learned that we can build relatively accurate models even with few
            measurements and that there are various heuristics for learning about
            interactions, rooted in common observations in real-world systems. So far, we
            focused mainly on a black-box approach, where we just measure performance
            while executing the system, but there are many opportunities for static and
            dynamic analyses to inform the sampling strategy and reduce the number of
            measurements.

            options are loaded from command-line options or configuration files and

            C code comes in very handy for analyzing PHP code.

    def php = ResearchTopic("Developer Support and Quality Assurance for PHP",
        <p>
            We developed a technique to analyze HTML, CSS, and Javascript code while it is
            still embedded as string literals in PHP code. PHP web application have the
            interesting characteristic of staged programs, where the server-side PHP code
            is executed to produce a client-side HTML and Javascript program. As a
            consequence, it is difficult to analyze the client-side code before the
            server-side code is executed. To solve this cross-stage analysis, we
            symbolically execute the server-side code to approximate all client-side
            output. The approximated client-side code contains symbolic values and
            decisions from control-flow decisions. Interestingly, this can be interpreted
            similar to unpreprocessed C code with conditional output and we can use the
            same variational parsers from TypeChef to build variational representations of
            the HTML DOM and JavaScript programs, and we can subsequently build
            variational call graphs on top to enable various forms of tool support from
            navigation, to bug detection, to refactoring, and to slicing []. This is a
            perfect example, where techniques originally developed for product lines can
            help to solve problems entirely outside the product line domain, in this case
            the analysis of staged programs.

        <p>
            Performance analysis of highly configurable systems can be generalized as a
            form of sensitivity analysis. The same techniques we use to learn
            {linkTopic(performance, Some("performance-influence models"))} can be used to understand design spaces and
            consequences of changes in domains outside of traditional product lines, as
            long as we can evaluate the impact of these changes in an interpreter. For
            example, we can model which changes to parameters or variable types in a
            robotics or high-performance computing have a significant impact on
            performance or accuracy. There is a broad field of potential application areas
            that potentially share similar characteristics about the nature of
            interactions of changes, where both black-box and white-box sensitivity-
            analysis techniques for highly-configurable systems can be reused.

    def vtests = ResearchTopic("Tests and Patches",
        <p>
            We explore variational-analysis techniques for exploring the effect and the
            interactions of multiple potential changes to a software system. By encoding
            each potential change as a configuration decision, we can use techniques such
            as variational execution to see which change or which combination of changes
            break a test. We hope that these techniques will allow efficient exploration
            of large search spaces, as used for mutation-based testing or automatic
            program repair.

              We analyzed how developers understand
              programs by directly observing brain area activations inside an fMRI scanner. While our initial project was
              focused on establishing the feasibility of fMRI as an technique for studying program comprehension (we
              confirmed many expected activations regarding short-term memory and language comprehension), this line
              of research can potentially help us in the long run to understand what makes programs complex and what
              form of complexity developers can handle well and what forms they struggle with. It may have further
              implications about how to teach programming or design programming languages {cite(icse14_fmri)}.
